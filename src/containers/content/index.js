                  I am a full-stack software engineer based in Toronto, ON.

                  I am currently working as a senior software engineer at EBlock
                  developing a real-time live auctioning platform. Previously I
                  have worked on the Cash app at Square, intelligent dispatch at Uber
                  and compilers at IBM.

                  I don't just write code. I carefully craft experiences that captivate users.
                  I treat my code like art - constantly striving for simplicity and elegance.

                  I love discussing and collaborating on new ideas, from the user experience
                  design to the nitty gritty technical details.
                  If you have an idea or a business problem, I would love to hear from you.
